The project contains a few random components used to practice React.
The most relevant files are App.tsx and everything in the services and hooks folder.

- http-service is a general http service class. You can pass whatever endpoint you want to access different objects from the API
- user-service is an exemple of an implementation of http-service on users
- useUsers is a custom hook to fetch all users
- App.tsx is the react component to show the api calls to fetch, delete, create and update a user. Creation and updates are hardcoded for the sake of practicing api calls.
